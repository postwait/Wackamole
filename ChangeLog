August 8th, 2001 (08.08.2001) -- wackamole -- 1.0.0
==========================================
 * Added this ChangeLog file.
 * Initial release.
 * Now supports Linux platform.

September 14th, 2001 (09.14.2001) -- wackamole -- 1.0.1
==========================================
 * Now brings down all its virtual interfaces when when it dies.
 * Now tries to reconnect to spread if it looses connection.	

November 5th, 2001 (11.01.2001) -- wackamole -- 1.2.0
===========================================
 * Added autoconf support (./configure)
 * Now supports FreeBSD platform.
 * Now supports Solaris 8 platform.
 * Now supports MacOSX platform.
 * Now daemonizes unless "-d" flag is given.
 * Write a PID file now.
 * Modified so that number of vitual ip's can be less than
	number of machines if some machines have config vip 0.0.0.0
 * Writes IP release/acquire information to syslog

November 15th, 2002 (11.15.2002) -- wackamole -- 2.0.0
===========================================
 * Revamped configuration file completely.  New format described in sample.
 * Allows/requires all interfaces to be named excplicitly to support machines
	with multiple interface cards on different VLANs and/or subnets.
 * Notifications are not to "a" router anymore.  An arbitrary list of CIDR form
	addresses can be specified explicitly by interface.
	All will receive ARP notifications of the MAC address change.
 * ARP cache is collected (FreeBSD and Linux supported) and that pool can be
	used as a notification destination for ARP updates.  (i.e. arp-spoof
	everyone in my arp cache).  ARP caches are announced and merged, so
	you wil hit every IP in the collective ARP cache of the cluster.
 * Added multi-threaded updates.  Each VIP that is started will spawn an
	arp-spoofing notification thread that will run through the list of
	recipients.
 * Allow for "no threading" via --with-threads=no configure option.
 * Notifications can be throttled so that notifications to larger networks will
	not cause ARP storms.  Notification lists are processed in a piecemeal
	fashion such that large throttled notifications will not starve other
        notifications.
 * A unix domain control socket was added and a simple control procotol was
	defined for out-of-band daemon control.
 * A standalone control program was stubbed (wackatrl) that can instruct
	the running wackamole instance to drop VIPs and disconnect from Spread.
	This isn't the ideal method of releasing responsibility, but it is a
	proof-of-concept.
 * Made reconnections to spread more robust and configurable.
 * Awful, awful, awful hack to fetch IPs from the system ARP cache on Solaris.
 * The failure and success causes perpetual reconnect attempts.  These attempts
	have been moved from their old blocking loop into the main loop.
 * Arp Spoofing is now done using the Spread event system
 * Now links correctly with Spread 3.17 (lib[t]spread.a) or 
	older versions (lib[t]sp.a)

July 28th, 2004 (07.28.2004) -- wackamole -- 2.1.0
===========================================
 * Allow for both non-threaded and threaded code.  Proper ifdefs.
 * non-threaded by default, there are problems with the threads.
 * RunDynamic directives to call loadable modules and embedder perl.
 * Fixed rampant endian problems.
 * Fixed CIDR form ranged arp notifications.
 * Shared arp cache is now IP and MAC -- includes fixes to buffer overruns
	triggered during collecting local ARP info on Solaris.
 * When arp-spoofing to IPs in the shared arp cache, both broadcast and
	directed ARP responses are done.
 * Hack for Linux to post process the VIF table after a balance that performs
	an if_down to make sure no other interfaces were casualties of that
	operation.
 * Added ping support so in addition to ARP spoofing, ICMP packets can be
	sent.

July 28th, 2004 (08.31.2004) -- wackamole -- 2.1.1
===========================================
 * No code changes.  Messed up distribution roll.  Fixed here.

September 9th, 2004 (09.07.2004) -- wackamole -- 2.1.2
===========================================
 * Fixed Linux ping construction (compile error)
 * Fixed double close in wackatrl
 * Fixed argument parsing

February 6th, 2007 (02.06.2007) -- wackamole -- 2.1.3
===========================================
 * Win32 support
 * patch for perl up and down invocations from Glenn Nielsen < glenn at mail
	dot more dot net >
 * patch from < pete at more dot net > and < anderson at more dot net >
	regarding uninitialized stack variable usable.  Fixes occasional
	interface operations on FreeBSD.
 * wrong string length of static strings, off-by-one. from Glenn Nielsen
	< glenn at maildot more dot net >
 * fork/setsid/fork now exits with 0 as it should
 * memcpy argument fix in Solaris DLIP ife driver

December 28th, 2007 (12.28.2007) -- wackamole -- 2.1.4
===========================================
 * Fix interfaces with numbers in them on Solaris (e1000g0)

                                 -- wackamole -- devel
===========================================
 * Warning and compile fixes on FreeBSD from Marcin Cieslak < saper at
	saper dot info >
 * Corrected 1.11 fix regarding interface instance numbers on Solaris from
	< todd at messagesystems dot com >
